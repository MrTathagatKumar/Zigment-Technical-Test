The lead's total score is the sum of the points from each of the criteria. For example, if a lead is highly interested, comes from a referral, and is in the SaaS industry, the score would be:
30 (Interest) + 20 (Source) + 30 (Industry) = 80 points.
Lead Scoring Ranges:
70-100 points: High-value leads (target immediately with welcome emails)
40-69 points: Medium-value leads (nurture)
0-39 points: Low-value leads (may require more engagement)
