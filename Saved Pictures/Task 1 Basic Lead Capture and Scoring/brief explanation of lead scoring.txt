Zapier Workflow Explanation
Trigger: New Form Submission (Google Forms)

What Happens: A new submission on the Google Form triggers the Zap.
Why: This initiates the process of scoring the lead based on the criteria provided in the form.
Action 1: Calculate Lead Score

What Happens: Zapier will calculate the lead score by using a "Formatter" action to assign points based on the form data. A custom formula or if/then conditions in Zapier will be used to calculate the total score.
Why: This step ensures that each lead gets a score based on their input.
Action 2: Add Lead to Google Sheets

What Happens: The lead’s details and their calculated score will be added to a Google Sheet in a "Leads" spreadsheet.
Why: Storing leads in a Google Sheet allows for easy tracking and further actions like segmenting leads based on their score.
Action 3: Send Welcome Email (for high-value leads)

What Happens: If the lead score is above 70, a welcome email is automatically sent via Gmail, welcoming them and providing additional information.
Why: A high-value lead receives immediate attention to increase the chances of conversion.
Action 4: Add Row to Nurturing Spreadsheet (for low and medium leads)

What Happens: If the lead score is below 70, Zapier will add the lead’s information to a separate "Nurturing" Google Sheets spreadsheet.
Why: Low- and medium-value leads are added to a nurturing list for further engagement via email campaigns, calls, or other marketing strategies.
